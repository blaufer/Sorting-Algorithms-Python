# Sorting Algorithms in Python

A collection of different sorting algorithms written in Python.

The file ```sorters.py``` includes all of the functions from the
other files and can be used to perfomr timing tests on them. Altering
what is contained on line 158 will allow one to use any one dimensional
set of data for these timing tests.
